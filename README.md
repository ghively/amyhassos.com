# Amy Hassos - Professional Portfolio

This portfolio website was reconstructed and modernized based on forensic recovery of data from `amyhassos.com` (circa 2018-2019) and professional profile documentation.

## How to Use
1.  **Open the Portfolio**: Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```
    (or double-click the file in Finder/Explorer)

2.  **Customization**:
    *   **Images**: The current images are placeholders from Unsplash. To personalize the site, replace the `url('...')` links in `index.html` with actual project screenshots.
    *   **Text**: Edit `index.html` with a text editor (like VS Code or Notepad) to update project descriptions or add new experience.

## Technology Stack
*   **HTML5**: Semantic and accessible structure.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Used via CDN for styling. No build step required—just edit and run.
*   **Fonts**: Montserrat and Open Sans from Google Fonts.

## Recovered Data Sources
*   **Resume/Experience**: Extracted from `profile.pdf`.
*   **Project Titles**: Inferred from the recovered URL structure of the previous website (e.g., `the-garden-project.html`, `mechanical-graphics.html`).
*   **Contact Info**: Preserved from the original site and profile.
